  <p class="chatter">Demand is high for pit bulls, but supply is much greater. Why are pit bulls overbred, and what effect does overbreeding have on shelters?</p>

<p class="byline">by Ian Round</p>


<p>Steve Penzcyk brought his two enormous pit bulls, Sonny and Megatron, to an event hosted by the Baltimore Animal Rescue and Care Shelter Nov. 3 at Baltimore’s Patterson Park. He also brought a friend, Michael Wells, to hold Megatron’s leash.</p>

<p>Under the pagoda, Penzcyk talked about how to handle dogs as big as his.</p>

<p>“It’s like having a Cadillac versus driving a Volkswagen,” he said. “You gotta respect the size of the Cadillac.”</p>

<aside class="pquote">
<blockquote>
  <p>"These <span class="light-blue">babies</span> are better <br> than what you think they are."</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>

<p>He went to BARCStoberfest, as the shelter’s annual event is known, to serve as an ambassador for pit bulls. He says the reputation they get is unfair. He looked into having a booth at the festival for people to meet his dogs and learn about pit bulls, but he said BARCS turned him down because he doesn’t have an organization and he’s not a vendor. Nevertheless, Penzcyk feels an obligation to educate the public about the dogs.</p>

<p>“I grew up with pits so I understand his calling,” Wells said. “We want to show people that these babies are better than what you think they are.”</p>

<h2><span class="red">"It's a status thing"</span>: Pit bull ownership and overbreeding</h2>

  <div id="container">
   <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-10">

<p>Pit bulls, once considered America’s dog, are now banned in some jurisdictions, including Prince George’s County, Maryland. Some landlords won’t accept potential tenants with pit bulls. Most insurance companies won’t cover pit bull bites. Tom Junod wrote in a 2014 Esquire <a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a23731/american-dog-0814/" Target="_blank">story</a> that people “employ racial thinking” in their arguments against pit bulls. Junod wrote that when a pit bull hurts a person or another dog, people tend to focus on the breed. But when, for example, a cocker spaniel bites someone, it’s taken as an isolated incident.</p>

<!--junod quote-->
  <p class="junod">"You see a well-heeled white woman walking a golden retriever and expect her to cross the street and give you a dirty look; you see the guy who's cutting down her trees or pressure-washing her driveway and you expect him to say: 'That's a beautiful dog.' Or: 'How much you want for that dog?' Or: 'You fight that dog?'"</p>

<p>Demand for pit bulls is high, but supply is greater. Penzcyk says “it’s a status thing” to own a pit bull. Flory said backyard breeders are active in poor communities like those of Baltimore City, and many of those dogs are bred to fight. She said breeding isn’t very lucrative, but “it’s a little extra cash, it’s status.” Because there are more dogs than people who want to provide them with safe homes, and many of those dogs are not spayed or neutered, shelters must pick up the slack.</p>

<p>“We only bring in as many animals as we can handle,” Flory said.</p>

<p>Many shelters, however, have to take in every animal that comes in, which leads to higher euthanasia rates. According to its <a href="https://barcs.org/about/" target="_blank">website</a>, BARCS, which must accept every animal, spared only 2 percent a decade ago; today more than 89 percent are spared.</p>

<p>Pit bulls, furthermore, aren’t a breed. At least three breeds, and mixes of other dogs with those breeds, fall under the pit bull umbrella.</p>


<p>Robbin Jacobs volunteered for the Maryland SPCA at BARCStoberfest. She said pit bulls “give you the impression that they’re really mean. . . . My impression of them has really changed.”</p>

<p>She also said that when pit bulls bite a person or a dog, the blame is extrapolated to all pit bull-type dogs. “When it’s not a pit bull, they don’t mention the breed,” she said.</p>


<p>At many shelters, more of the dogs are pit bulls or pit mixes than other breeds. For example, out of 64 dogs at the Maryland SPCA on Nov. 28, 24 were pit bulls, said Katie Flory, the shelter's director of community affairs.</p>

<h2>How frequent is <span class="red">euthanasia</span> in shelters?</h2>

<!--euthanasia frequency pie chart-->
<div class="graphic-container">
 <p>According to estimates from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, about one in five dogs that enters a shelter is euthanized. Pit bulls account for more than half of dogs in some shelters.</p>

<!-- END euthanasia frequency chart-->

<p>Flory said that at the Maryland SPCA, longer wait times don’t result in euthanasia for pit bulls. She said the Maryland SPCA's live release rate is 95 percent. She says some animals are not adoptable and others are too sick, and would pose a risk to the rest of the shelter's population. </p>

<p>“[A yellow lab] may get snapped up right away but the pit bull still gets adopted,” she said.</p>

<h2><span class="red">Breed-specific</span> legislation</h2>

<div id="container">
 <div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-10">
<p>Those who support breed-specific legislation often cite a 1997 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC looked at the deaths caused by dogs between 1989 and 1994, of which there were 109. More than half of the victims were children under the age of 10. Pit bulls were responsible more often than any other breed; pit bulls and Rottweilers were responsible for about half.</p>

<div class="graphic-container">
 <h3>Deadly dog <span class="red">attacks</span> by breed, 1989-1994</h3>
 <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studied 109 human deaths caused by dogs. It found pit bulls were responsible more often than other breeds. However, researchers noted that breed-specific legislation is misguided.</p>
 <div id="shootingsByTypeChart"></div>
 <em>Source: <a href>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8657532</a></em>
</div>
<!-- end dog attacks by breed chart-->

<p>Many concluded, including, notably, the Maryland Supreme Court in a 2012 decision, that pit bulls were inherently dangerous. Cities, towns and counties across the country, including Prince George’s County, banned the dogs (Prince George’s County banned the dogs before the CDC study was published).</p>

<p>For example, when a town outside Denver was considering lifting its 26-year-old pit bull ban, the Denver Post Editorial Board cited the CDC in support of the ban, concluding that pit bulls are not worth the risk.</p>

<p>“It’s not that pit bulls can’t be gentle and loving dogs,” the editorial board <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2018/01/29/pit-bull-bans-are-still-justified/" target="_blank"> wrote</a>. “The issue is that if a pit bull turns out to be temperamental, the outcome is so often worse for the victim.”</p>

<p>(Castle Rock ended its 26-year-old ban in May 2018, becoming the first municipality in Colorado to lift a ban).</p>

<p>The column neglected to note that the CDC explicitly cautioned against concluding pit bulls were dangerous. It said we should not respond with breed-specific legislation, but with education, responsible ownership and improved healthcare for the dogs.</p>

<aside class="pquote">
<blockquote>
  <p>"I think it's stupid.<br>There's no merit behind it at all."</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>

<p>“Breed-specific approaches to the control of dog bites do not address the issue that many breeds are involved in the problem and that most of the factors contributing to dog bites are related to the level of responsibility exercised by dog owners,” the authors wrote.</p>

<p>Penzcyk put it another way. “I think it’s stupid,” he said. “There’s no merit behind it at all.”
He said pit bulls have the reputation they do “because a lot of stupid people have the dogs.”</p>

<p>Deirdre Franklin, who founded the advocacy group Pinups for Pit Bulls, wrote in her <a href="https://animalstudiesrepository.org/anippol/1/" Target="_blank">master’s thesis</a> that breed specific legislation doesn’t increase public safety and doesn’t save taxpayers money. Her organization had a table at BARCStoberfest, although she wasn’t present. Erika Kovacs, a volunteer, said the organization’s goal is “to change the face of the dogs and to stop the discrimination they face.”</p>

<p>Rebecca Vogel, the other volunteer, said she doesn’t like the vague umbrella term used to describe the American Pit Bull Terrier, the American Staffordshire Terrier, the American Bulldog, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and mixes of other dogs with those breeds. In addition to the term being subjective—people tend to apply the one-drop rule to pit bull mixes—the term “pit bull” calls to mind bull baiting.</p>

<p>Flory said bull-baiting is only part of the story. “They were actually bred to be nannies to children,” she said. They are nanny dogs. They love children.”</p>

<p>Franklin cited a 2007 study by Karen Delise, the results of which strongly suggested that pit bulls were a product of their environment. Delise found that 97 percent of fatal dog attacks were committed by dogs who had not been spayed or neutered; 84 percent of those dogs were “abused or neglected” or “unsupervised”; and “78 percent of the owners did not maintain their dogs as pets.”</p>

<h2>Preventative programming</h2>

<div id="container">
 <div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-10">
<p>The Maryland SPCA is not just reactive but proactive, undertaking initiatives designed to stop overbreeding and irresponsible ownership. One thing Flory does is “get in as many schools as I can and teach students about kindness to animals.” The organization also hosts pop-up training classes, gives people free collars and leashes (Flory said some owners use telephone cords or wires because they don’t have leashes) and provides healthcare, among other programs.</p>

<p>Shelters are good for individual dogs, but without programming like the SPCA’s, they can’t stop the next dog from being neglected, abused or abandoned.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Flory suggests, maybe we should give the benefit of the doubt to some of the people we characterize as bad dog owners. Maybe we should examine the “racial thinking” Tom Junod wrote about.</p>

<p>“It’s not that these communities don't love their pets,” she said. “They absolutely do.”</p>

<p>She said some people have to abandon their dog if they’re moving, for example, and someone on their block adopts the dog. The person that adopts the dog from the street might work multiple jobs, or might not be able to get a ride to the vet, despite wanting to “help an animal they are not responsible for.”</p>

<p>“So in my book, that’s a pretty great person,” Flory said. “We don’t just have a problem with animal abuse, we have a problem with kindness to each other.”</p>
