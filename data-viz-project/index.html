    <p><span class="firstcharacter">O</span>n September 8, Naomi Osaka made her mark in women's tennis history. The 20-year-old rising tennis player not only became the Japanese athlete win a career Grand Slam title, she did so against her idol Serena Williams in straight sets. But Osaka’s win is not what most fans will remember. Instead, the game was marked by escalating tensions between the chair umpire and Williams.</p><br>

    <p>During the second set, chair umpire Carlos Ramos issued Williams a coaching violation after her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou was seen gesturing to Williams. She approached the umpire to express her disagreement stating:</p>

    <div class="pullquote"> “I don't cheat to win. I'd rather lose.”</div>

    <p>After breaking a racket a few games later, Williams received a second violation that led to a point penalization. Once more, Williams articulated her frustrations with Ramos which continued into the changeover. She called him a “liar” and a “thief” for taking a point from her. Ramos considered her verbal exchange to be another violation and docked her an entire game, placing Osaka one step closer to victory at 5-3.</p><br>

    <p>Williams asked to speak to the tournament directors and told them she was being unfairly treated. She claimed male players rarely get penalized for the same code violations. She demanded an apology from Ramos.</p><br>

    <p>Osaka went on to win the match 6-4, but her celebration was marred. Williams congratulated Osaka, who was in tears, at the net and refused to shake Ramos’ hand, as is customary. Ramos left the court to an uproar of booing, which continued into the trophy ceremony.</p><br>

    <p>Williams tried to contain booing by praising Osaka’s performance, who was also crying – a product of the mood created during the match. “Let’s make this the best moment we can, and we’ll get through it…and let’s not boo anymore,” Williams said.</p><br>

    <p>Even against the crowd favorite, Osaka showed humility as she gave her speech.</p>

    <div class="pullquote">"It was also my dream to play Serena in the US Open final, and I'm really glad I was able to do that...I'm grateful I was able to play with you. Thank you."</div>

    <div class="heading"><b><a name="timeline">The Evolution of Women's Rights in Tennis</a></b></div>

    <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he feminist movement beginning in the 1960’s reformed traditional sporting practices by challenging male dominance of sports and deconstructing stereotypical representation of women. One of the products of this movement was the enactment of Title IX in 1972 - a law that prohibits discrimination under federally funded institutions based on sex.</p><br>

    <p>In 1973, former Wimbledon champion Bobby Riggs competed against female tennis player Billie Jean King in what became known as the Battle of the Sexes. King endured misogynistic slurs during the game from both her opponent and commentators. However, her victory over Riggs is credited with spurring greater participation in and attention to women’s tennis. That same year, King launched the Women's Tennis Federation (WTA) to defend the interest of female players around a stronger organization.</p><br><br>

    <p>Women’s inclusion in major tennis tournaments, notably the Grand Slams, came years after their male counterparts. So did equal pay. Even today, male and female tennis athletes play in the same courts, under similar conditions, but women are paid significantly less. According to data from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2018/jul/14/tennis-pay-gap-shouldnt-be-gender-based">The Guardian</a>, “71 per cent of the world’s top 100 men have earned more than women of the same ranking, based on prize money per tournament played.”</p><br><br>

The median pay gap between a woman in the top 100 and her opposite number on the men’s tour is $120,624."</p><br><br>

      <p>And for those who believe men’s tennis attracts larger audiences, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2018/jul/14/tennis-pay-gap-shouldnt-be-gender-based">The Guardian</a> found that “from 2010 to 2014, the women’s US Open final drew a larger audience in America than the men’s final. Part of that was due to Serena Williams appearing in four of those finals. But more people tuned in to watch Kim Clijsters’s win in 2010 than they did for Nadal’s victory the same year, and more than 1.5m more people watched Samantha Stosur win than Djokovic in 2011.”</p><br>

      <p>Despite the positive achievements and strides of female athletes in tennis, it is difficult to predict how attitudes towards women’s sports will progress. If history is any indication, the battle is far from over.</p><br><br>

      <p><span class="firstcharacter">U</span>ntil 1972, when the U.S. Congress passed Title IX, opportunities for women to participate in sports and sport related activities were limited or nonexistent. Prior to this date, women were excluded from organized sports both in leagues and in schools. Sports for women only occurred in informal settings that emphasized physical activity and recreational nature. Over forty years after the passage of Title IX, women’s involvement in sports has improved. Yet, female athletes are judged based on physical beauty ideals rather than skills and ability and receive considerably less media coverage and prize money than their male counterparts.</p>

      <div class="heading"><b><a name="data">What The Data Says About Inequality In Tennis</a></b></div><br>

      <p><span class="firstcharacter">O</span>ne question that emerged from the 2018 U.S. Open Women's Final was whether women are penalized more than men on court. During the match, after receiving a game penalty, Williams <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/14/sports/tennis-fines-men-women.html">exchanged</a> words with the umpire:<br>

      <div class="pullquote"> “There are men out here that do a lot worse...but because I’m a woman, because I’m a woman, you’re going to take this away from me? That is not right.”</div>

      <p>So, was Williams right?</p><br>

      <p>According to data by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/14/sports/tennis-fines-men-women.html">New York Times</a>, men are issued more fines in Grand Slam tournaments between 1998 to 2018 in all but two categories: no coaching and no press. Williams' comments alluded to the fact that women are more likely to be penalized for coaching than her male counterparts. The table below breaks down the data:</p>

      <br><br>

      </div>
      <!-- END second graphic container-->

      <p>In tournaments besides Grand Slams, female tennis players are  allowed to receive on court coaching during changeovers in a match. It might follow that umpires are stricter with coaching from the stands in WTA matches because women are allowed to receive coaching on-court at several times during the game. Coaching from the stands is never alowed, but perhaps it should be.</p><br>

      <p>Besides equality on the court, female athletes face gender discrimination challenges off the court. Namely, the audience for women's sports is growing, but coverage isn't. </p><br><br>

      <p>Nielsen Sports found that 84 percent of general sports fans around the world are interested in women's sports. Furthermore, over half, 51 percent, are men. If the demand for women's sports exist, why doesn't the media coverage reflect this?</p><br><br>

      <p>Not only are women's sports significantly underrepresented in the media, but there is a certain stigma attached to women's sports. Instead of showing womne's sports as part of its regular programming, ESPN created a separate channel, espnW, solely for women's sports. ESPN is not alone. Julie DiCaro, a sports broadcaster and columnist, was critical of espnW. “It seems like this is the broadcasting equivalent of making something pink and putting sparkles on it," she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/16/sports/16espnw.html">said</a>.</p><br>

      <p>In 2017, USC researchers <a href="https://news.usc.edu/127695/forget-about-sexism-now-tv-coverage-of-womens-sports-is-just-plain-boring/">published</a> a study in the journal Gender & Society which found that ESPN's SportsCenter only devoted 2 percent of airtime to women's sports. Michael A. Messner, one of the study's authors, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/16/sports/16espnw.html">said</a> espnW "might ultimately ghettoize women’s sports and kind of take ESPN off the hook in terms of actually covering them on its main broadcast.”</p><br>

      <p>Women's sports has achieved significant strides in the past decades, since the passage of Title IX. Tennis officials need to make rule changes that reflect the current status of women in society. And equality in tennis is not just a one way street. If women are allowed to receive on-court coaching, men should be allowed the same. And if men are allowed to change their shirts on court, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/aug/29/alize-cornet-penalty-shirt-removal-us-open-tennis-heat">women</a> should be allowed to do the same. But without more attention paid to women's sports in broadcasting and print media, there is still a long way towards gender equality in sports.
